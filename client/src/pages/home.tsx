              In this surreal drama-comedy, two Taiwanese-American brothers return to Taipei for Chinese New Year, carrying baggage both literal and emotionalâ€”including the ashes of a childhood cat. Set against political tension and ancestral ritual, <em>Not Our Home, Not Our Home</em> explores the costs of immigration, the ache of cultural dissonance, and the ghosts we carry across generations. Laced with dark humor, horror elements, and underscored by a lush original score, this play blurs the line between memory and myth, asking: What do we owe the places we leave behindâ€”and the people we become?

                    Josh, an Astoria based actor, is all the enthusiastic adjectives to be playing Youngest in this production of Not Our Home, Not Our Home! Last time he did the short version of this play, he told everyone to see Maybe Happy Ending--but since ticket prices have skyrocketed, he recommends at least the cast album.

                    John Jiang is from Xinjiang China, and he came to the US at age of 15 to attend Cheshire Academy where he found his passion in acting, since then he acquired his BA in theater from Union College, and he recently graduated as a company member from American Academy of Dramatic Art. In the past decade, he has taken on a wide variety of roles on stage, such as Mary/Bingly from Pride And Prejudices, Lord Illingworth from A Woman of No Important and G. from Polaroid Stories, etc. He is extremely grateful and excited for this opportunity to bring this story to life at the Rogue Theater Festival. He would like to thank everyone who has helped him along his journey, especially his family who unfortunately cannot make it to the show.

Growing up in a predominantly Taiwanese community, he has a keen understanding of both the joys and tensions within the immigrant experience. His work, rich in themes of belonging and inherited guilt, explores what it means to navigate identity in a world of shifting expectations.

He's grateful for every chance to experiment and bring to life the ideas that have been quietly stirring within him for years.

                  <TruncatedBio>
                    Yung-Hung Sung, a lighting and scenic designer originally from Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Sung has collaborated with numerous theatre artists and companies. With over 90 productions, his design footprints have already been seen around several nations/festivals and major theaters in Taiwan, such as the National Theater of Taiwan, National Taichung Theater (Taiwan), and the National Kaohsiung Center for the Arts. Also, Edinburgh International Festival Fringe (UK), Proyector Festival (Spain), Beijing Dance Festival, Shanghai International Festival of Arts (China), Migration Matters Festival (UK), ChangMu Performing Arts Festival (Korea), Festival of Avignon Off (France), etc. Selected awards include Long River with WCdance, which was selected to be the annual winner of the 13th Taishin Arts Award. Panta Rhei, which was nominated for Emerging Lighting Design, World Stage Design Exhibition 2017 in Taipei, Taiwan. Ten Lines of Poetry to NK with Neo-Classic Chamber Ensemble, which received Bronze for Professional Lighting Design at the World Stage Design Exhibition 2022 in Calgary, Canada. He holds a Design MFA from Yale, the David Geffen School of Drama. He is also the recipient of the Jennifer Tipton Scholarship in Lighting, the Stanley McCandless Scholarship, the Donald and Zorka Oenslager Scholarship in Stage Design, the William and Sarah Hyman Scholarship, and the Government Scholarship to Study Abroad by the Ministry of Education, Taiwan. With the urgency to respond to the outbreaking global events and as a designer who sees all sectors in panorama, Sung finds the uniqueness and essence of live performance lie in its direct, multi-dimensional impact on the perceivers. He strives to use scenography as a medium to dissect the human condition, initiate inner dialogues, declare personal statements, and spark not only profound discussions but even reveal evasive conflicts. In line with the foregoing, he believes the emotional connection between the performers and the audience transcends the use of sophisticated words, intellectual concepts, and stunning visual effects. A thought-provoking performance can happen on a bare stage devoid of any design. "Scenography exists only when it helps tell a story better."

                <p>
                  This play began with a dream: laughing red faces, a belly sloshing with Moutai, andâ€”most stubbornlyâ€”the slow, annoying burn of guilt. From that strange dream bloomed <em>Not Our Home, Not Our Home</em>, a song of many notes: of immigration and memory, of brothers and borders, of languages spoken and unspoken.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At first, I thought I was going to be writing about belonging. But that questionâ€”do we belong?â€”has been asked by better writers than me and has never been a question I was interested in. What lingered wasn't the asking, but what comes after the answer. When we say yes, or no, or something in betweenâ€”what do we lose in the choosing? What parts of ourselves get buried? What parts are invented?
                </p>
                <p>
                  That's where guilt creeps in. When belonging becomes a choice, guilt rushes in to fill the cracks. Guilt is the beating heart of this story. How do we carry it? How do we name it? What if it's not even ours, but something passed downâ€”quietly, relentlessly? And guilt doesn't just hauntâ€”it twists us, reshapes us, pushes us into doing the dumbest, most laughably human things. Guilt is powerful, yes. But it can also be deeply stupid and absurd.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We showed one small scene in December 2024 at the Immigrants in America Festival in Court Square Theater. To our joy, we won! In April 2025, we read the play aloud at the Dramatist Guild Foundation. Now, we plan to preview it at the Rogue Theater Festival, and soon, at the Theater for the New City. Each step has been a soft miracle. I intend to carry this story Off-Broadway, into bigger rooms. There's a bigger play in this. I'm not sure what it is yet, but I trust my actors and my crew to walk with me toward it.

                  Thank you to my cast and crew. You hauled props and yourselves across town, and kept showing up in the dog days of summerâ€”tired, sweating, cracking jokes, still managing to inspire me.
